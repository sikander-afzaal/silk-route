          Silk Route is an immigration consultancy firm that specializes in
          helping individuals gain permanent residency in the European Union via
          business development. We pride ourselves on being one of the best
          residency programs in Europe, and that begins with knowing our clients
          through and through. Taking into account their educational background,
          work experience, and areas of expertise, we design and plant companies
          in Latvia that establish EU residency, all while ensuring control of
          the company stays in the clientâ€™s hands. We find great satisfaction in
          providing our customers with the highest quality of support and care
          from the earliest stages of the process to when they finally settle
          into their new homes. Our team of experienced immigration lawyers and
          board of advisors are experts in their respective fields, and because
          they understand the migration process inside and out, they know how to
          take the fear out of the unknown. With headquarters located in the
          Netherlands, and branch offices in Riga and Delhi, Silk Route aims to
          advise, assist, and accompany our clients throughout the entire
          migration process.
